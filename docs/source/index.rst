NumDF
*****

NumDF is a finite element based method for constructing the PDF, CDF and inverse CDF of a user defined function or simulation output. 
Distinct from the traditional binning approach to constructing a density our numerical algorithm makes explicit use of the functional form 
of the expression or simulation field provided.

NumDF is written in python and makes extensive use of the finite element method solver `Firedrake <https://www.Firedrakeproject.org>`_.
