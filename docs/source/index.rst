NumDF
*****

NumDF an abbreviation of numerical density function is a finite element based method for constructing the pdf, cdf and qdf 
(or inverse cdf) of an arbitrary user defined function or simulation output defined on an arbitrary space. Distinct from 
the tradtional binnning approach to constructing a density our numerical algorithim makes explicit use of the functional form 
of the expression or simulation field provided.

NumDF is written in python and makes extensive use of the finite element method solver firedrake.
