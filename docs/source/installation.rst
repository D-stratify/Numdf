Installing NumDF
****************

NumDF is written in python and depends on the finite element solver firedrake. For this 
reason we first recommend Installing firedrake as detailed `here <https://www.firedrakeproject.org/download.html>`_.

Once installed active your firedrake environment::

    source firedrake/bin/activate

NumDF can then be installed from the python package index PyPI::

    python3 -m pip install NumDF
