Installing NumDF
****************

NumDF is written in Python and depends on the finite element solver Firedrake. For this 
reason we first recommend installing Firedrake as detailed `here <https://www.Firedrakeproject.org/download.html>`_.

Once installed active your Firedrake environment::

    source firedrake/bin/activate

NumDF can then be installed from the Python package index PyPI::

    python3 -m pip install NumDF
